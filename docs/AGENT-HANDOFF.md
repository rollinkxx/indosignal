# Agent Handoff: Multipair Scanner & Application Audit

**Last updated:** 2026-11-04 12:53 WIB
**Repository:** `rollinkxx/indosignal`
**Latest `main` observed:** `f14ac49722434dc78f9c44bc92132e38b9ed2b03`
**Purpose:** Durable work log and source of truth for agents continuing scanner, audit, or remediation. Read this before starting; update it as work progresses, not only at session end.

## Resume snapshot — reconcile with Git before acting

**Last reconciled:** 2026-11-04 12:42 WIB against `origin/main` at `f14ac49`.
**Current focus:** H-04, `IN PROGRESS`, branch `ci/require-handoff-on-code-pr`; implementing an automated PR gate so source/config changes cannot omit the task-row handoff update. Approved plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-04-handoff-ci-enforcement.md`.
**Immediate next action:** Push branch `ci/require-handoff-on-code-pr`, open its PR, and verify the H-04 gate and full quality-gates in GitHub CI; merge only if all checks pass.
**Next application priority after H-04:** A-01 remains `TODO`: recover and review the prior uncommitted remediation patch; no A-01 code edits are in progress.
**Last known code verification:** Baseline commit `6f34565e4314c2e3852eb569f8a408e418932546` passed typecheck, 12 test files / 74 tests, static market-mock and Docker-security checks, and production build on 2026-11-04. That evidence does not prove live provider, production, DB, or Docker image behavior.
**Known blockers:** No disposable/staging PostgreSQL target, current Hostless configuration/deployment evidence, or external WORM receipt is recorded. See A-03 through A-06 below.
**Conversation handoff:** Use `docs/AGENT-RESUME-TEMPLATE.md` for a prior-session link. Read that history for intent/decisions only, then reconcile every status/claim against Git, CI, and this tracker.

## Start here — required protocol

1. Read this file and the relevant design/runbook documents. Check `git status --short --branch`, current branch, `git log -1`, and fetch the latest `origin/main`. Do not assume a change exists because it appeared in another conversation or ephemeral workspace.
2. Before implementing a task, create/update its row in the tracker below: set `IN PROGRESS`, record the working branch, narrow next action, and acceptance evidence. If this is a new task, add a new ID and row first. Never erase history; append dated entries to the change log.
3. Work in small logical slices. After each meaningful slice, run the narrowest relevant test/check, update the row with files and commit SHA plus the exact command/result, then commit. Push the branch after each verified slice when remote access is available. Do not accumulate a large uncommitted batch.
4. If context, time, or credit may run out, stop adding scope. Save the current safe state, update this file with what changed, what did not, current branch/commit, exact verification (including failures), and one concrete next action. Commit and push that checkpoint. If pushing is impossible, record the exact reason and local commit SHA so recovery is straightforward.
5. Before handoff, check the repository again, ensure the tracker matches the tree and commit history, and summarize unresolved blockers. Use `DONE` only for the acceptance criteria actually verified; distinguish code written, tests passed, CI passed, deployment completed, and production behavior observed.

Credit remaining is not a reliable project signal; therefore checkpoint by work slice rather than waiting for a warning that may not arrive. Never put credentials, secret values, database URLs, private keys, or sensitive production data in this file, logs, commit messages, or command output.

## Status definitions and update format

Use only these statuses:

- `TODO` — not started or not yet attempted in the current repository state.
- `IN PROGRESS` — an agent has begun; include branch and immediate next action.
- `BLOCKED` — cannot proceed without a named external dependency, access, decision, or safe test environment; specify exactly what would unblock it.
- `DONE` — acceptance evidence exists and was verified on the recorded commit/environment. If only a subset is complete, split it into a separate row or leave the row in progress.

Each row must answer: what is the state; where is the work (branch/commit/files); what command or observation proves it; what happens next; and what is blocking it. Do not use “done” to mean merely “implemented”.

### Detail for A-01: prior audit's reported changes (not present/verified in this checkout)

The previous audit session described a local uncommitted batch covering: shared migration-version registry; disposable-database guards in DB proof scripts; same-run audit-chain migration/verifier; readiness cache; market freshness refresh; backtest caveats and error redaction; minimal public health response; PWA offline shell; multipair warm-up budget; and Docker build checks in CI. Do not mark any of these as applied until the full change is recovered, reviewed, and present on a recorded branch/commit. Do not blindly copy partial artifact snapshots or apply a database migration to production.

### Safe database and production rules

For DB proof scripts, require an explicitly disposable/staging target, keep `TEST_DATABASE_URL` distinct from `DATABASE_URL`, ensure scripts fail closed on unsafe targets, and never print URLs. Production Hostless checks are read-only unless a separately authorized, reviewed deployment plan explicitly says otherwise. Do not substitute `DATABASE_URL` for `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, change production secrets, or trigger a deployment just to clear this tracker.

## Copyable checkpoint template

Append a dated entry after each meaningful slice and update the corresponding task row above:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ — <task ID> — <short checkpoint>
- Status: IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED | DONE
- Branch / commit: `<branch>` / `<sha>`
- Changed files: `<paths>`
- Verification: `<exact command or observation>` — `<result/count>`
- Not verified: `<remaining proof boundary>`
- Next action: `<one concrete action>`
- Blocker: `<none or exact dependency>`
```

## Completion criteria for scanner/audit remediation

Call the overall scanner/audit task complete only when each relevant tracker row is separately resolved: recovered remediation is reviewed and committed; typecheck, full tests, static checks, production build, and required CI pass on the recorded change; disposable/staging DB integration passes; an actual Docker production image build passes; current Hostless configuration/deployment/readiness has evidence; and any residual WORM/anchor limitation is evidenced or explicitly accepted. A local build or green documentation PR is not proof of production recovery.

## Change log

- 2026-11-04 12:15 WIB — Added the initial detailed handoff and linked it from README (PR #4, merged as `e2ed4fe`).
- 2026-11-04 12:24 WIB — Committed and pushed checkpoint protocol, explicit statuses, task table, template, and README start instructions as `3318452`; documentation checks passed locally; CI/PR pending.
- 2026-11-04 12:26 WIB — PR #5 quality-gates passed and the checkpoint protocol was merged; main merge commit `8fb15b7`. H-02 marked `DONE` with verified evidence.
- 2026-11-04 12:36 WIB — H-03 checkpoint `44994c2` adds root agent instructions, a resume snapshot, copyable conversation-link prompt, and PR checklist; scripted documentation/reference checks and `git diff --check` passed. PR/CI pending.
- 2026-11-04 12:38 WIB — PR #7 `CI/quality-gates` passed; context-recovery system merged as `d3226ac`. H-03 marked `DONE`; next work is A-01 as stated in the resume snapshot.
- 2026-11-04 12:45 WIB — H-04 classifier and nine unit tests added; red-phase failure confirmed the test imported a missing checker, then green-phase passed. Package script and pull-request CI wiring added; full verification and PR CI pending.
- 2026-11-04 12:46 WIB — Typecheck exposed TS7016 on the new `.mjs` import; root cause is `allowJs=false` with no declaration file. Existing `.d.mts` pattern was verified; next add a local typed declaration and rerun.
- 2026-11-04 12:47 WIB — Added `scripts/check-handoff-update.d.mts`; typecheck now passes and full suite passes (13 files / 83 tests). Proceed to real diff/CLI and CI validation.
- 2026-11-04 12:48 WIB — Real branch CLI check failed despite unit tests passing. Root cause confirmed: repository Git config colorizes the unified diff with ANSI escapes, so the task-row matcher safely rejected it. Next disable color explicitly and add a forced-color CLI integration test.
- 2026-11-04 12:50 WIB — Added `--no-color` and a temporary-repository integration test with `color.ui=always`; focused tests now pass (10), typecheck passes, full suite passes (13 files / 84 tests), and the checker passes on `f14ac49...fbe2ba8`.
- 2026-11-04 12:51 WIB — Expanded the forced-color integration test to prove source-only CLI rejection followed by acceptance after task-row update; added valid-SHA/unavailable-Git fail-closed coverage. Focused suite passes (11); full suite rerun pending.
- 2026-11-04 12:52 WIB — Typecheck passes; full suite passes (13 files / 85 tests); focused checker suite passes (11); `git diff --check` passes. No local YAML/actionlint parser is installed, so final workflow validation is delegated to PR CI.
- 2026-11-04 12:53 WIB — Commit `63cd0a8` records the no-color fix and forced-color tests; `check:handoff-update f14ac49 63cd0a8` passes on the real branch diff. Workflow was visually reviewed; GitHub CI remains the final workflow parser/execution check.
