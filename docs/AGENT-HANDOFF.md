# Agent Handoff: Multipair Scanner & Application Audit

**Last updated:** 2026-11-04 12:38 WIB
**Repository:** `rollinkxx/indosignal`
**Latest `main` observed:** `d3226acaf24b9ba3a3eb933aeaf5615557e53e8f`
**Purpose:** Durable work log and source of truth for agents continuing scanner, audit, or remediation. Read this before starting; update it as work progresses, not only at session end.

## Resume snapshot — reconcile with Git before acting

**Last reconciled:** 2026-11-04 12:38 WIB against `origin/main` at `d3226ac`.
**Current focus:** H-03 context-recovery system is merged and `DONE` (PR #7; merge `d3226ac`). Next application task is A-01: recover and review the previous uncommitted remediation patch; no code edits for A-01 are in progress in this checkout.
**Immediate next action:** For A-01, inspect the available session artifacts/history, compare candidate file snapshots against `origin/main`, and restore only a complete, reviewable patch on a feature branch. If no full patch can be recovered, document that and pick up the highest-value remediation without repeating verified baseline checks.
**Existing application work priority after H-03:** A-01 is still `TODO`. Recover the full prior uncommitted remediation patch and compare it with current Git before editing; do not assume it exists in this checkout.
**Last known code verification:** Baseline commit `6f34565e4314c2e3852eb569f8a408e418932546` passed typecheck, 12 test files / 74 tests, static market-mock and Docker-security checks, and production build on 2026-11-04. That evidence does not prove live provider, production, DB, or Docker image behavior.
**Known blockers:** No disposable/staging PostgreSQL target, current Hostless configuration/deployment evidence, or external WORM receipt is recorded. See A-03 through A-06 below.
**Conversation handoff:** Use `docs/AGENT-RESUME-TEMPLATE.md` for a prior-session link. Read that history for intent/decisions only, then reconcile every status/claim against Git, CI, and this tracker.

## Start here — required protocol

1. Read this file and the relevant design/runbook documents. Check `git status --short --branch`, current branch, `git log -1`, and fetch the latest `origin/main`. Do not assume a change exists because it appeared in another conversation or ephemeral workspace.
2. Before implementing a task, create/update its row in the tracker below: set `IN PROGRESS`, record the working branch, narrow next action, and acceptance evidence. If this is a new task, add a new ID and row first. Never erase history; append dated entries to the change log.
3. Work in small logical slices. After each meaningful slice, run the narrowest relevant test/check, update the row with files and commit SHA plus the exact command/result, then commit. Push the branch after each verified slice when remote access is available. Do not accumulate a large uncommitted batch.
4. If context, time, or credit may run out, stop adding scope. Save the current safe state, update this file with what changed, what did not, current branch/commit, exact verification (including failures), and one concrete next action. Commit and push that checkpoint. If pushing is impossible, record the exact reason and local commit SHA so recovery is straightforward.
5. Before handoff, check the repository again, ensure the tracker matches the tree and commit history, and summarize unresolved blockers. Use `DONE` only for the acceptance criteria actually verified; distinguish code written, tests passed, CI passed, deployment completed, and production behavior observed.

Credit remaining is not a reliable project signal; therefore checkpoint by work slice rather than waiting for a warning that may not arrive. Never put credentials, secret values, database URLs, private keys, or sensitive production data in this file, logs, commit messages, or command output.

## Status definitions and update format

Use only these statuses:

- `TODO` — not started or not yet attempted in the current repository state.
- `IN PROGRESS` — an agent has begun; include branch and immediate next action.
- `BLOCKED` — cannot proceed without a named external dependency, access, decision, or safe test environment; specify exactly what would unblock it.
- `DONE` — acceptance evidence exists and was verified on the recorded commit/environment. If only a subset is complete, split it into a separate row or leave the row in progress.

Each row must answer: what is the state; where is the work (branch/commit/files); what command or observation proves it; what happens next; and what is blocking it. Do not use “done” to mean merely “implemented”.

### Detail for A-01: prior audit's reported changes (not present/verified in this checkout)

The previous audit session described a local uncommitted batch covering: shared migration-version registry; disposable-database guards in DB proof scripts; same-run audit-chain migration/verifier; readiness cache; market freshness refresh; backtest caveats and error redaction; minimal public health response; PWA offline shell; multipair warm-up budget; and Docker build checks in CI. Do not mark any of these as applied until the full change is recovered, reviewed, and present on a recorded branch/commit. Do not blindly copy partial artifact snapshots or apply a database migration to production.

### Safe database and production rules

For DB proof scripts, require an explicitly disposable/staging target, keep `TEST_DATABASE_URL` distinct from `DATABASE_URL`, ensure scripts fail closed on unsafe targets, and never print URLs. Production Hostless checks are read-only unless a separately authorized, reviewed deployment plan explicitly says otherwise. Do not substitute `DATABASE_URL` for `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, change production secrets, or trigger a deployment just to clear this tracker.

## Copyable checkpoint template

Append a dated entry after each meaningful slice and update the corresponding task row above:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ — <task ID> — <short checkpoint>
- Status: IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED | DONE
- Branch / commit: `<branch>` / `<sha>`
- Changed files: `<paths>`
- Verification: `<exact command or observation>` — `<result/count>`
- Not verified: `<remaining proof boundary>`
- Next action: `<one concrete action>`
- Blocker: `<none or exact dependency>`
```

## Completion criteria for scanner/audit remediation

Call the overall scanner/audit task complete only when each relevant tracker row is separately resolved: recovered remediation is reviewed and committed; typecheck, full tests, static checks, production build, and required CI pass on the recorded change; disposable/staging DB integration passes; an actual Docker production image build passes; current Hostless configuration/deployment/readiness has evidence; and any residual WORM/anchor limitation is evidenced or explicitly accepted. A local build or green documentation PR is not proof of production recovery.
